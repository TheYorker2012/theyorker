    <h2>DataEdit (complex situation)</h2>
    manage a record with a many-to-many relation<br />
    (articles relations with other articles).

    <?=$edit?>
       
    note:<br />
    There are better ways to manage this kind of relation.. but it's a sample, and basically I want to show how you can build complex crud intefaces with one <em>iframeField</em> and <em>many controllers</em>.
