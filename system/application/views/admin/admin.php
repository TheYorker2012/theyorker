<div>
<h1>Admin Menu</h1>
<p>
This is just a placeholder page at the moment, this will be the menu for all logged in admins.
This will need to show differant content depending on which admin control panels the person has access to.

For the moment lets just have links to the current admin pages, add yours as you make it:
</p>

<a href='/admin/yorkerdirectory/'>Edit the directory</a><br>
<a href='/admin/yorkerdirectoryview/'>Edit entry in the directory</a>
