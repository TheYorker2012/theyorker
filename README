Doxygen

To create doxygen documentation, execute the command "doxygen"
in this directory. This will create some folders such as:
  html/
  latex/
in which the documentation is stored in different formats.

E.g. to see html documentation see:
  html/index.html

n.b. Do not add these folders to the repository as they are
temporary and can easily be recreated.

Other formats of documentation can be enabled by editing the
file Doxyfile in this directory.

See http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/config.html for more
information about the configuration file.
