The Yorker Blackbox Testing Script

This program is for testing The Yorker in a blackbox fashion. It
sends HTTP requests to get pages, performs various checks on them
and can run them through a local validator.

Due to the link checking nature of this program when the depth is
set to a non-zero value, this program can generate a lot of traffic.
It is therefore unadvisable to run this unecessarily on the live
site until some modifications have been made.

Dependencies

Getopt::Long;
LWP::UserAgent;
HTML::Entities;
Term::ANSIColor;
WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C;

Usage

./blackbox.pl
  -h|--host <host>      - Hostname to test
  {initial paths}       - A set of initial paths to start the test
  [-d|--depth <depth>]  - Set the maximum depth to search
  [-v|--validate]       - W3C validation using http://localhost/w3c-validator/check

Examples

To test release.dev.theyorker.co.uk following a maximum path of 2
links and starting from /calendar:

  ./blackbox.pl --validate --depth=2 --host=release.dev.theyorker.co.uk /calendar

To validate the individual page /charity on the live site:

  ./blackbox.pl --validate --host=www.theyorker.co.uk /charity
